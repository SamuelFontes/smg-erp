# smg-erp [Work in progress]

This is the back-end of an ordering system that I plan to expand it to a ERP system someday in the future. 
It's built with support to mult-tenant in mind so it can use a single database to multiple clients without having to
host a application for each client.
Right now it will only provide a rest API and I don't plan on changing that, it's planned to be used as a back-end to digital stores that use different ways of selling products such as discord and whatsapp.
It's currently being built following the MVC structure but I'm planning into changing it to a micro-services with a DDD approach.
There isn't much done yet but I'm planning on deploying this in production as soon as it can do the basics.
